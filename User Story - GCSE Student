As a GCSE Geography student, I want to use a program that will give me different data based on cities, populations and language

I envision that the program will have features that allow me to see different populations, countries, continents and languages in a format of organised lists where i will
be able to see different data sets in reports based on my input. I would like this as this program would allow me to have easy comparisons to use for my current GCSE
Geography course homework. It would let me learn how populations line up accordingly with countries as well as popularity of languages

An example is if i input the number of '5' as the top 'N' populated countries in the world, continent or region, i expect to be given the population size of different
countries in descending order in a list. It would give me the names along with the population size, giving me the information i need for studying for my course.
In addition, it would be nice to have a feature that tells me the most spoken languages from greatest to smallest so i would be able to learn the percentages of the
world in which these are spoken, allowing me to learn rough numbers of the people who speak the language.

By using this program i hope to gain better understanding of the dispersion of population in the world as well as the correspondence of languages spoken to the populated
continents. I also wish that the country report will help me learn about specifics on it, letting me recognise differences between countries in different continents.
